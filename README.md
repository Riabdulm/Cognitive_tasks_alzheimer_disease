# Cognitive_tasks_alzheimer_disease
Analyzing Alzheimer's Disease Patients and their ability to recall shapes (Coloured or natural grey) using RStudio.


### Introduction

The report is based on task designed to test the ability of participants
on some cognitive tasks. The cognitive task will test the recollection
of shapes that are either with different type of colours or just neutral
grey colour among these participants.

This test involved 90 participants, where 45 are diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease, and the other 45 have no cognitive impairment. Each
participant underwent 100 number of trials for the identification of
differently coloured shapes, and neutral grey shapes.


## Objectives of the Report

The report will achieve its objectives in two parts;

1.  Part one will give an understanding of the Dataset.

2.  In Part two, statistical hypotheses will be designed and assessed to
    answer some questions relating to whether or not people diagnosed
    with Alzheimer (Alzheimer’s patients) are worse at the cognitive
    tasks.
